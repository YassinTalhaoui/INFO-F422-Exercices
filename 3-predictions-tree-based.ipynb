    "### Supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of supervised learning involves the presence of an entity (the learner, also called prediction model), whose goal is to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs in a given problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A supervised learning problem can formulated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    " y = m(\\mathbf{x})  \n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $y$ represents the output variable (also called target)\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{x}$ represents the vector of inputs (also called features).\n",
    "- $m$ is the (unknown) mapping between input and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the majority of the supervised learning problems, the mapping $m$ between input and outputs is unknown and needs to be estimated on basis of the available input/output observation pairs $(\\mathbf{x}_i,y_i)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification vs regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Both classification and regression are sub-fields of *supervised learning*. In the two cases, we have predictive variables $\\mathbf{x}$ and a target variable $y$. \n",
    "The main difference betweet the two type of problems is the type of the target variabile:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In classification, $y$ is a discrete variable; i.e $y \\in \\{C_1,\\cdots,C_k\\}$\n",
    "- In regression, $y$ is a continuous variable; i.e $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical, in order to better understand the classification process, we will tackle the simplest classification case, with $k=2$ possible output classes (called binary classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of our approach is to be able to learn the mapping between the input features and the predefined discrete output classes, in order to be able to perform an automatic classification, based on the available data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate the problem with a simple example :\n",
    "* Knowing the two abstract features $X_1$ and $X_2$, and $n=6$ samples for both class (the red class and the blue class), can you predict the label for the green sample ?\n"

    "\n",
    "### Model structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A classification tree is a model employing a tree-based structure in order to perform classification of the target variable.\n",
    "The tree structure contains internal nodes, and terminal nodes (often called leaves).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each internal node is associated to a feature in the input vector $\\mathbf{x}$, and performs a partition of the input space according to the value of the associated feature.\n",
    "Each terminal node is associated to a specific output label $C_i$.\n",
    "Internal nodes can be concatenated with each other in order to specify additional partitions of the input space.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these definitions, we can notice that the terminal nodes partitions the input space into mutually exclusive regions (in a divide-and-conquer fashion). \n",
    "\n",
    "The classification operation is performed by traversing the tree from the root node until one of the terminal nodes is reached.\n",
    "At each intermediate internal node, a decision is made according to the value associated to the corresponding feature (for example, for the i-th feature $x_i \\geq 0$).\n",
    "According to the outcome of this decision, a different path in the tree is taken.\n",
    "The tree traversal is stopped once a terminal node is reached, and the output of the classifier correspond to the label associated to the terminal node (e.g. $C_0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, by simply looking at the tree structure, we can easily understand the sequence of operations (i.e. splits) that yielded to the classification decision, improving interpretability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "As an analogy to their biological equivalent, the learning procedure for a decision tree has two steps known as *tree growing* and *tree pruning*.\n",

    "\n",
    "    * The **Gini Impurity** (used in CART) : how often a randomly chosen element would be incorrectly labeled if it was randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset. It is minimum (zero) for class-homogeneous nodes.\n",

    "## Exercise 4 - Ensemble learning : Boosting (Ada Boost)\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is an additional generic ensemble technique which attempts to boost the accuracy of any given learning algorithm.\n",
    "The focus of boosting methods is to produce a series of weak learners in order to produce a powerful combination. \n",
    "A weak learner is a learner that has accuracy only slightly better than chance.\n",
    "In boosting, the training set used for each member of the series is chosen based on the performance of the earlier classifier(s) in the series. \n",
    "Examples that are incorrectly predicted by previous classifiers in the series are chosen more often than examples that were correctly predicted.\n",
    "Thus Boosting attempts to produce new classifiers that are better able to predict examples for which the current ensembleâs performance is poor. \n",
    "Unlike Bagging (employed in Random Forests), the resampling of the training set is dependent on the performance of the earlier classifiers, which prevents a parallel implementation of the ensembling procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise you need to:\n",
    "- Implement a boosting ensemble of 15 decision trees using Ada Boost (cf. 11.3.1)\n",
    "- The initial sampling probability for each sample $i$ is $w_i = \\frac{1}{N}$ (with $1 \\leq i \\leq N$, $N$ being the number of samples in train set). \n",
    "- After the first tree, $w_i$ is adjusted according to the classification performances:\n",
    "    \\begin{equation} w_i = w_i \\begin{cases} e^{-\\alpha_j} & \\text{if sample $i$ correctly classified} \\\\ e^{\\alpha_j} & \\text{if sample $i$ incorrectly classified} \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\n",
    "    \\begin{equation} \\alpha_j = \\log(\\frac{1-ER_j}{ER_j}) \\end{equation}\n",
    "    \\begin{equation} E_j = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} I\\left(y_{i} \\neq h_{j}\\left(x_{i}\\right)\\right)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i}} \\end{equation}\n",
    "      \n",
    "- The prediction of the boosting ensemble is defined as a linear combination (weighted by $\\alpha_j$) of the outputs of the different trees:\n",
    "    \\begin{equation} h_{boo} = sign\\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{m} = \\alpha_j*h_j(x)\\right) \\end{equation}\n",
